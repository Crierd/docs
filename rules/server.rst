Bugs
----
Using the script in a way that it is not intended for gain is against the rules and the issue should be posted on the `bug tracker`_.

This includes using GTA's physics in a unrealistic way such as bunny hopping and vehicle rolling.

AFKing
------
AFKing should not be done in a public place or in a way that obstructs others roleplay.
