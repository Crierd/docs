Always Roleplay
===============
All players must remain in character at all times unless allowed to go out of character by an administrator or they are themselves an administrator.

*"Roleplay now,* `report <https://owlgaming.net/support/>`_ *later."*

Brawls
------
Standard procedure is to fight in an RP manner, however, players can OOCly agree to perform a fight in a brawl done with GTA physics.

Vehicular Pursuits
------------------
An exception of always roleplay is doing a PIT maneuver during a chase.

MetaGaming
==========
MetaGaming is when someone uses out of character (OOC) information for in character (IC) purposes. If you attempt to
incite MetaGaming, then you're also breaking rules.

PowerGaming
===========
A player can be described as a PowerGamer if he or she presumes or declares that his or her own action against another player
character is successful without giving the other player character the freedom to act on his or her own decisions. This includes
but is not limited to:

* Forcing actions upon a player.
* Failing to allow a player to roleplay their own actions. 
* Use of items which you haven't physically obtained.
* Acting superhuman.

Character Development
-----------------------
Character development plays a vital role in what is considered PowerGaming. A character that goes to the gym and works out regularly
may be in better physical condition than others involved in the situation.

Special Characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Special Characters are characters which have a particular subset of skills (superior strength, shooting, stamina, etc), such as but not
limited to:

* Mentally Challenged
* Skilled Martial Artists
* Members of Special Operations Forces

These characters must have `UA`_ approval prior to roleplaying as such.

Vehicles
----------
Vehicles which are used as they are not designed, such a lowrider offroading is considered PowerGaming as the vehicle would not be
able to sustain such conditions without breaking or becoming inoperable.

Deathmatching
=============
Deathmatching is the act of killing another persons character without sufficient reason or proper roleplay.

Death
============

Player Kills
-------------
In the event of your character being killed through roleplay, said character loses memory of the event once respawned. This character may not continue the roleplay or return to the same location. The loss of memory extends as far back as that particular roleplay situation's beginning.

Character Kills
---------------

Extreme or Disgusting Roleplay
===============================
Every party involved, including witnesses, must OOCly agree to participate in any of the situations listed below:

* Rape
* Cannibalism
* Pedophilia
* Bestiality
* Necrophilia
* Sexual Harassment

You may withdraw your consent at anytime during the roleplay.

Logging to Avoid
================
Players are forbidden from logging out during a roleplay unless approved by an administrator. Do  not join in a large roleplay situation if you cannot commit the time.

Law Enforcement Situations
--------------------------
After an evasion from law enforcement, or any engagement with such organizations, you must wait 30 minutes prior to logging off.

Provoking
==========
Seeking attention from law enforcement or emergency services by shouting at them, making 911 calls to be chased, etc, is prohibited.
Evidence
=========
All actions may leave traces left behind from the roleplay. Such as, but not limited to: 

* CCTV Footage
* Finger Prints
* Tire Treads or Shoe Imprints
* Broken Locks / Doors
* Glass Fragments 
* Civilian Witnesses
* Etcetera

Notes should be dropped indicating this evidence and information must be given to any overseeing administrators so they may relay the information to investigative parties.

Vehicle Descriptions
====================
Vehicle descriptions via /ed should be used to present the physical features of the car, not internal specifications or information which cannot be readily seen from the outside.

CCTV Cameras
============
CCTV Cameras are by default, roleplayed as a 90 degree angle camera with 480p resolution at 5 frames per second. The data must be stored somewhere when roleplaying the install. All CCTV camera installations/upgrades must be approved by an administrator and added to the interior note. Footage is wiped at the end of the week if nothing of significance has occurred unless otherwise specified.

All government buildings and gas stations are assumed to have sufficient cameras to cover most common angles both inside and outside.
