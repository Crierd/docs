Always Roleplay
===============
No player is allowed to force a situation out of character unless it is an administrator. *"Roleplay now, report later"*.

Brawls
------
Standard procedure is to fight in an RP manner, however players can OOCly agree to perform a fight in a brawl done with GTA physics.

Vehicular Pursuits
------------------
An exception of always roleplay is doing a PIT maneuver during a chase.

MetaGaming
==========
MetaGaming is when someone uses out of character (OOC) information for in character (IC) purposes. If you attempt to
incite MetaGaming, then you're also breaking rules.

PowerGaming
===========
A player can be described as a PowerGamer if he or she presumes or declares that his or her own action against another player
character is successful without giving the other player character the freedom to act on his or her own decisions. This includes
but is not limited to: forcing actions upon a player, failing to allow a player to roleplay their own actions, use items which
you haven't physically obtained or acting superhuman.

Character Development
-----------------------
Character development plays a vital role in what is considered PowerGaming. A character that goes to the gym and works out regularly
may be in better physical condition than others involved in the situation.

Special Characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Special Characters are characters which have a particular subset of skills(superior strength, shooting, stamina, etc), such as but not
limited to:
* Mentally Challenged
* Martial Arts Masters
* Special Army Operations Officers

These characters must have `UA`_ approval prior to roleplaying as such.

Vehicles
----------
Vehicles which are used as they are not designed, such a lowrider offroading is considered PowerGaming as the vehicle would not be
able to perform properly in such conditions.

Deathmatching
=============
Deathmatching is the act of killing another persons character without sufficient reason or proper roleplay.

Death
============

Player Kills
-------------
In the event of your character being roleplayly killed, said character loses memory of the said event once respawned. This character may not
continue the roleplay or return to the same location.

Character Kills
---------------

Extreme or Disgusting Roleplay
===============================
Every party involved(including witnesses) must OOCly agree to the below sorts of roleplay taking place;

* Rape
* Cannibalism
* Pedophilia
* Bestiality
* Necrophilia
* Sexual harassment

You may withdraw your consent at anytime during the roleplay.

Logging to Avoid
================
Players are forbidden from logging out during a roleplay unless approved by an administrator. Do  not join in a large roleplay situation if you cannot
commit the time.

Law Enforcement Situations
--------------------------
After an evasion from law enforcement, or any engagement with such organizations, you must wait 30 minutes prior to logging off.

Provoking
==========
Seeking attention from law enforcement by 911 calls to be chased or shouting at cops, etc is prohibited. D

Evidence
=========
All actions may leave traces left behind from the roleplay. Such as, but not limited to, CCTV footage, breaking locks, glass, civilian witnesses, etc.

Vehicle Descriptions
====================
Vehicle descriptions via /ed should be used to present the physical features of the car, not internal specifications.

CCTV Cameras
============
CCTV Cameras are defaultly roleplayed as a 90 degree angle camera, 480p resolution, with 5 frames per second. The data must be stored somewhere when
roleplaying the install. All CCTV camera installs/upgrades must be approved by an admin and added to the interior notes. Footage is wiped at the end
of the week if nothing of significance has occurred.

All government buildings and gas stations are assumed to have cameras.
