Roleplay Rules
==============
These rules are general roleplay rules and are the most important as many situations should be applied to these core rules.

MetaGaming
----------
MetaGaming is when someone uses out of character (OOC) information for in character (IC) purposes. If you attempt to
incite MetaGaming, then you're also breaking rules.

PowerGaming
-----------
A player can be described as a PowerGamer if he or she presumes or declares that his or her own action against another player
character is successful without giving the other player character the freedom to act on his or her own decisions. This includes
but is not limited to: forcing actions upon a player, failing to allow a player to roleplay their own actions, use items which
you haven't physically obtained or acting superhuman.

Character Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Character development plays a vital role in what is considered PowerGaming. A character that goes to the gym and works out regularly
may be in better physical condition than others involved in the situation.

Vehicles
~~~~~~~~
Vehicles which are used as they are not designed, such a lowrider offroading is considered PowerGaming as the vehicle would not be
able to perform properly in such conditions.
