Criminal Rules
##############
.. note::

The OwlGaming Criminal Roleplay Rules are set up due to the high amount of criminal roleplayers and in order to set limitations and somehow create a market. Money should flow and allowing only certain people to do specific actions can ensure that. We also aim to let people venture in new kinds of roleplay, which they didn't do before, sadly this has to be done by setting limitations, sometimes.

Restricted Areas
================
You may not commit serious crimes on purpose in high profile areas without adequate law enforcement on duty. You may check if there are enough law enforcement by asking an administrator. This limitation, however, is not to be used as a "safe zone". If you are being chased by an attacker and run onto the steps of a police station, this does not mean they must suddenly stop all illegal activity.

* Los Santos County Sheriff's Department HQ & precincts (including their surrounding perimeters)
* All Saints General Hospital / County General Hospital (including their surrounding perimeters)
* Los Santos Fire Department HQ & subdivision buildings (including their surrounding perimeters)
* City Hall (including its surrounding perimeters)
* Bank of Los Santos - Rodeo Bank perimeter (with the exception of a permitted robbery)
* Superior Court of San Andreas HQ (including its surrounding perimeters)
* San Andreas Detention Center (including their and it's surrounding perimeters)

Arson
=====
Comitting arson requires that an adequate number of emergency service employees are online to respond to the fire and must be approved by any administrator. All arson requires the owner of the property to be online when the request is made to administrators.

Small Fires
-----------
Vehicles, small buildings without anyone inside, sheds, and similar places may be targeted with arson provided that there are at least two firefighters online.

Large Fires
-----------
Large buildings, buildings with people inside, forest fires, and similar places may be targeted with arson provided there are at least five firefighters online.

Property Break-Ins & Robbery & Theft
====================================
If administrative intervention is necessary to complete a robbery or theft, such as unlocking a door that was kicked in, it must adhere to the following rules and needs administrative approval. If a door was left open for example and you just walked in, you do not need to follow the rules below or approval.

Residential Property
--------------------
All private residential property may be broken into and burglarized. The owner of the property must be online when the request is made in conjunction with at least two law enforcement officers. 

Commercial Property
-------------------
Commercial property such as storefronts, offices, businesses, etc, may be broken into and burgalarized. At least two law enforcement must be online. The owner does not need to be online.

Faction & Government Property
-----------------------------
Since there is no owner for faction or government properties, only the requisite amount of law enforcement must be online. Factions may have stashes that are approved by the Faction Team which require their approval to break into.

Warrants & Property Inspections
-------------------------------
Law enforcement and emergency services personnel may enter properties without the owner needing to be online with a sufficient enough reason such as serving a search or arrest warrant, entering the property with exigent circumstances, performing a fire inspection, etc.

Safes
-----
Unless otherwise specified, all safes in interiors are to be roleplayed as mid-tier household safes.

Specific Limitations
--------------------
Some pieces of property require Upper Administration Approval to break into. They are:

  * Evidence Storage
  * Gun Shops
  * Banks
  
Robberies In General
--------------------
You may not rob / steal:

  * If you have less than 10 hours on your character.
  * Other characters with less than 5 hours.
  * On-duty law enforcement officer's equipment without administraive permission.
  * Faction badges or identification cards.
  * Automated teller machine cards (unless the player agrees).
  * Private custom skins (unless the player agrees).
  * More than $3,000 from someone's bank account utilizing their stolen automated teller card (unless they agree).

Character Robberies
-------------------
You may not player kill someone just before, during, or directly after a petty robbery. This is to prevent abuse of the amnesia effect when normally violence would not be utilized. The exception to this is if someone shows disregard for their life or there is some other exigent circumstance such as police showing up and you shoot at them to prevent them tackling you if you try to escape.
  
Vehicle Robbery
---------------
Vehicle robbery means vehicles which are broken into and have the contents inside stolen. They do not require the owner to be online and are treated like faction or government property robberies, however, government vehicles require permission from an upper administrator to be broken into.

Vehicle Theft
-------------
Vehicle theft refers to actually taking and moving the vehicle in question. This may only be done or attempted once every 24 hours. Just like robbery, government vehicles require permission from an upper administrator. An exception to this is a spontaneous vehicle pursuit and the government vehicle in question is co-opted.

Performing illegal roleplay
===========================
Roleplay that is deemed 'illegal' is strictly forbidden in and around any establishment that is Government owned. The following is a list of places that are protected by this rule:
 
* Los Santos County Sheriff's Department HQ & precincts (including their surrounding perimeters)
* All Saints General Hospital / County General Hospital (including their surrounding perimeters)
* Los Santos Fire Department HQ & subdivision buildings (including their surrounding perimeters)
* City Hall (including its surrounding perimeters)
* Bank of Los Santos - Rodeo Bank perimeter (with the exception of a permitted robbery)
* Superior Court of San Andreas HQ (including its surrounding perimeters)
* San Andreas Detention Center (including their and it's surrounding perimeters)
 
Trial Administrators+ are allowed to make exceptions to this rule. With their permission, you may commit crime in these listed areas on a case by case basis. UAT permission is required to assassinate/injure key figures in the places mentioned above (Ex. Shooting at the Commissioner during a speech at City Hall).
 
Destroying properties
=====================
Any sort of roleplay that requires a fire in order to destroy or attempt to destroy a business or property needs permission from a Trial Administrator+. You must provide a valid roleplay reason and have the necessary items to perform the deed. If you wish to create a small fire, such as a vehicle or similar things, you need 2 firefighters (not academy students) on duty. Major fires such as buildings require 5 firefighters.
 
The owner(s) of the property must be online in order to proceed. You will be supervised by the administrator that accepts your request. The property will also be toggled once the roleplay is deemed good and the emergency services couldn't save it.
 
Property robberies
==================
All establishments in the server require permission to be robbed (excluding Government owned, as these are forbidden) from a Trial Administrator+. In order to proceed with a robbery, you'll require a valid reason and any tools needed to perform the roleplay. Whilst robbing, you may take whatever you like in whatever quantity you can hold, however within realistic reason (i.e. if you were robbing weapons, you wouldn't roleplay taking a shops worth if you only had a small duffel bag).
Specific robberies & details:
 
Bank of Los Santos: To perform a robbery on a small office the Upper Administration Team will be needed. 
 
Ammunations: Requires UAT authorization (UAT contact required), where it will be agreed on possible minimum and maximum outcome of the robbery. The robbery itself can be supervised by any admin+ once authorized by UAT, as only admin+ has the ability to spawn in the required possible loot.
 
When robbing a privately owned house/personal garage (owned by a player), the owner of said property must be online on the character that has ownership of the property at the start of the robbery. If the owner logs during the robbery, it will be deemed valid and the robbery may continue. All items in the property can be robbed, along with generics which can't be picked up (will be given by the handling administrator).  This does not count for things you can't rob without player approval, found under rule 4.
 
When robbing a storefront/business (owned by a player), the owner of the property is not required to be online. You may rob the NPC clerk, and the handling admin will spawn a reasonable amount of money based on the store type and where it's located. 
 
Law Enforcement Officers may break into properties without the owner online, if they have an official (on paper) search warrant issued by the Superior Courts of San Andreas.
 
Safe cracking is limited to players with sufficient knowledge and high quality roleplay is expected from the cracker. Safes are considered to be low tier unless stated otherwise in the /checkint of the interior. In order to have a higher quality safe you must RP purchasing one(/charity the money) and have a generic item of the model of the safe in your interior. A admin can then edit the interiors note to state that it would have a safe of higher quality in which would be much harder to break into.
 
A minimum of 2 SD is needed on duty (patrolling).
 
Character robberies
===================
Who you can't rob:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Anyone, if you have less than 10 hours on your character
* Players with less than 5 hours on their character
* On-duty law enforcement officers (requires UAT permission)
* Corpses of player-killed characters.
 
What you can't rob:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Faction badges;
* ATM cards, personal skins and vehicle/property keys, unless the player agree to it;
* More than $3,000 from someone's ATM card & bank account, after having stolen the card;
* Duty weaponry, kevlar vests, radio's and other duty material for specific factions.
 
You may not Player Kill/Character Kill the character during/directly after the robbery unless both parties agree OOCly. This is to prevent abuse of game mechanics and give the victim, and PD, a realistic chance to respond. However victims must be reminded to properly roleplay their fear accordingly.
 
The robbery may turn into a CK/PK situation if the player acts in a way that endangers his/her life showing disregard for the consequences of their actions.
 
Vehicle robberies
=================
You must have a minimum of 10 hours on your character in order to steal a vehicle. You may also attempt to steal only one vehicle per day, if the attempt failed, you're out of chances.
 
When stealing a vehicle left running on the streets, the owner must be online. If he is not online, it is most likely due to a bug. If the key is in the inventory of a vehicle, you may steal the car without admin permission.
 
Vehicles which belong to governmental factions may not be robbed nor raided, unless given permission by a member of the Upper Administration Team. In the event of a spontaneous vehicular pursuit, permission may not be required to steal a government vehicle if it is in fact running and unlocked.
 
Robbing a player of their car, when they're actively in the car should not require supervision and will fall under normal character robbery rules (see rule 4). This means you're not allowed to take their key without consent, but you're allowed to attempt to steal their vehicle from their person, should this be a part of the active robbery.
 
Vehicle chopping & illegal acquirement
======================================
Chopping:
In order to chop a vehicle, your character must have at least 20 hours. The activity of the owner is irrelevant.
 
To chop a vehicle you must be well equipped and the money given may depend on the roleplay quality. There's certain modifiers that will be applied, based on vehicle and parts included. Chopping is for the done for the spare parts and scrap metal, so the money you get will reflect on that.
 
However, owning a crusher and crushing vehicles illegally is allowed as well. The crusher must have been an actual investment and been installed with flawless roleplay. The received amount will then be limited to the legal crusher price, nothing more.
 
Acquiring:
Forgers must have at least 25 hours on their character. The activity status of the owner is irrelevant, but the vehicle must have been successfully stolen by the forger or someone affiliated to the forger.
 
You may request to perform a vehicle forge through the means of a UAT Public Contact. In order to have your roleplay approved please send the RP logs and any other information to the handling UAT Member.
 
Drugs production
================
Producing drugs is only possible for people affiliated to an illegal faction (official and unofficial) who must contact the Faction Team in order to set up either a drug farm/drug production: a faction may not produce more than one time per week and must provide logs of the production process to the FMT when claiming their weekly production results which need to be as detailed and realistic as possible.
 
The FMT will then define the amount that the character running the farm/lab will receive per week through a random generated number based on the global size of the operation.
 
Illegal weapons
===============
Stat-transferring weapons is forbidden as the weapons are character-bound when obtained, even if your other character has a weapon license. Caught doing this will count under the same offense as any other alt-alt incident.
