General Misconduct
==================ff
Do not troll, flame, spam, post meaningless content such as single word or off-topic replies, or participate in otherwise disruptive behavior. 

Constructive criticism and rational or mature discussion which may illicit an overeactive response does not mean the person making the valid point is trolling or flaming. Insulting someone because of a post they made is flaming, telling them you disagree beacuse of a certain reason is not. 

Illegal Content
===============
Do not post material or links to content which is illegal as per United States, Canadian, and International law.

Advertisingf
===========
Do not advertise other roleplaying communities or competitors to Owl Gaming.

English
=======
Do not post on public sections in anything other than legible English.

Inappropriate Content
=====================
Do not post nudity, gore, or otherwise inappropriate content without spoilers, warnings, and a reason. Do not post such thing without a reason. For example, illegal roleplayers discussing cartels in real life and showing a video of a shootout would be acceptable, showing random gore for shock value is not.

Deleting Content
