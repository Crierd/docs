Gates
===============
Gates may only be placed on property that you own. If you do not own the property, the owner of the property must grant you permission to place a gate on the property. In order to request a gate, contact the Mapping Team. You must provide logs of gate installation after the Mapping Team accepts your gate. 

Generic Items
=============
In general, generic items that adversely affect others during roleplay situations must be present such as gloves to prevent fingerprints, a bat to bludgeon someone, a CCTV camera to provide surveillance, etc. Generic items which do not adversely affect others in general, are not required, like a toolbox you pull a hammer out of.

All legally obtainable generics must be purchased in character through shops or the appropriate faction providing delivery services. Minor exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for spawning legal items under specific situations which are time sensitive such as needing a tire iron to change a tire when it is otherwise completely unavailable or where an item would reasonably be present and is necessary to roleplay like breaking into a police car and stealing the computer inside.

Exceptions for items which are not rare and commonly available at big box stores may be made by the handling administrator at their own discretion.

Generic items are not to be used in world 0 to replace exterior world mapping.

Items which have an illegal use and thus the purchase would not be registered or taxed, should be acquired through illegal factions in the server or a request to the Faction Team. 

Interiors
=========
When purchasing an interior you must also buy the associated interiors that come with it. An example being buying a house, and having to buy the garage that comes with it. You may not buy a garage and then not buy the house. If you do this, you will have the interior removed from you.

If an interior is disabled via means of roleplay such as a fire, natural disaster, etc, it must be renovated to be enabled again. Roleplay must be provided to an administrator and documented in the interiors history.

Weapon Licenses
===============
Weapon licenses may be attained in character by filing the required paperwork found on the Los Santos Police Department website. 

Legally purchased weapons and ammunition may not be sold on the black market or to friends illegally. Legally purchased weapons may also not be used for criminal purposes.

It is prohibited to stat transfer weapons. If this rule is broken, punishment similar to alt to alt will occur.

Tier 1 and 2 licenses availbiites and restrictions are dependent on the in character laws at the time. A Tier 3 license must be requested from the Faction Team.
